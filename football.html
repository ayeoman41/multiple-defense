        <h1>MULTIPLE DEFENSE</h1>
        <h2>Philopsophy</h2>
        <p>The overall intention of this defense is simplify a players alignment and assignment which will allow each 
            individual player to play without much thinking.  The reduction of thinking is designed to allow for execution at
            a high level.  This playbook should be thought of as a toolbox.  There is never a need for every single tool on 
            every job.  Use the tools that are of need and save the other tools for another job.</p>

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        Alignment is one of the most important things to know as a defender.  It helps knowing where to be on each formation
        so that a team cannot formation you to gain a numbers advantage.  Each defensive position in the playbook will start
        out with explaining each defenders alignment. <p><em>Note:</em> The alignment will be shown from a 1 deep
        safety alignment. The coach can choose if 2 deep safeties are of better use.</p>
        <h3>Playbook setup</h3>
        <p> The playbook will start out with many of the terms that will be needed to develop an understanding of the 
            playbook.  The order in which the information will be provided will start with: 
            <ol><li>Defensive Line</li>
            <li>Linebackers</li>
            <li>Secondary</li></ol>
        <h1><strong>DEFENSIVE LINE</strong></h1>
        <p>The defensive line will consist of 4 players.  Two defensive ends: The <em>Alpha</em> and the <em>End.</em> 
        Two defensive tackles: The <em>Nose</em> and the <em>Tackle.</em>  The <em>Alpha</em> will always align into the 
        boundary and the <em>End</em> will align to the field of every offensive formation.  If the the football
        is in the middle of the field, the <em>Alpha</em> will default to the left of the offense. The <em>Nose</em> will 
        align to the weak side of the formation and the <em>Tackle</em> will align to the strong side
        of the formation.  <p><em>Note:</em> 
        The <strong>boundary</strong> is the short side of the field if the football is one the hash.  What a coach designates as the strong
        or weak side of an offensive formation is up to the coach.</p>

        <p>Provided in the image below are the defensive line techniques <em>(0,1,2i...)</em>as well as the 
            gaps <em>(A,B,C..)</em></p>

        <p>Each of the defensive line fronts are linked with images of how each defensive line should line up based 
            on the defensive call.  The images <strong>only</strong> show <em>RE</em> and <em>LE</em> for the defensive ends 
            because the Alpha will line up to the boundary side of the football field.</p>

    <h1><strong>Linebackers</strong></h1>
    <p>The Linebacker position will consist of 3 players.  The names that can be used are up to the defensive coach. In 
    this playbook they will be called <strong>Mike, Will, and Sam.</strong>  In some defenses  they will line up
    depending on the strength of the formation.  In this playbook the <em>Sam</em> will go to the wide side of the field and the 
    <em>Will</em> will go to the boundary.  The <em>Mike</em> linebacker will always be in the middle of the <em>Sam</em> and
    <em>Will.</em></p>
    <p>Links to the 2nd and 3rd level adjustments to how linebackers line up to formations are listed below:</p>
    <ol><li><a href="../images/2ndleveladj.jpg">2nd Level Adjustments</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/2ndlvlali.jpg">2nd Level Alignment</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/3la.jpg">3rd Level Alignment</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/apex.jpg">Apex Alignment</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/Lev.jpg">Leverage Alignment</a></li></ol>
    <p><strong><em>Note:</strong></em> Alignment 3 and 4 show the formation to the field, the same adjustments can be applied
        to the boundary.</p>
    <p>There are 3 ways in which the linbackers will line up based on a formation:
    <li><a href="../images/stack.jpg">Stack</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/gap.jpg">Gap</a></li>
    <li><a href="../images/30s.jpg">30's<a/></li></p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</em></strong> In the <em>Gap</em> alignment it is shown with just an "OUT" call,
        gap can also be used if there is a "WIDE" call from the Will.  Aslo the 30's alignment is shown with an
    "OUT" and "WIDE" call, 30's can also be used a "KICK" call in a Trips/Trio formation.</p>

    <h1>Secondary</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em>The defensive secondary will be shown from a 1 high safety.</p>
    <p>Cover 3 <em>(Green)</em> will be the defensive coverage.  The one high safety will take the middle 1/3 between the hashes.
        The two corners will take the outside 1/3 of the field.  The "strong" safety will always align to the wide
    side of the field, while the Will linebacker will always go to the boundary.  The linebackers will and strong
    safety will drop under wide recievers in what will be called a match up zone.  Use the link to discover the zones
    used within this defense. <a href="../images/covareas.jpg">Coverage Areas</a></p>
